## Simulators on Arris Commscope

I had the opportunity to create different simulators, using the VanillaJS technology.
  Which increased my knowledge about the collection of information to create apps,
  the management of different versions, collaborative work.

## Collaboration with ColmenaTech on Odoo

I had the opportunity to collaborate with ColmenaTech in
   the implementation of AWS virtual machines, with Ubuntu
   and the Odoo CRM for electronic invoicing in Costa Rica.
This collaboration gave me many opportunities to put into practice the knowledge of installing Linux systems,
  with the deployment and exploitation of the CRM, obtaining skills in reading system registers,
  solving connection errors and creating virtual VLAN connections.
I managed to deploy the container system, with the collaboration of [joker charlie / odoo-dkr-cr: 12.0],
  Understand the virtualization system with containers, creating my own script to deploy all the containers,
  reaching the final publication of the connected Odoo CRM with the SQL engine "PostgreSQL"
Thus learning to handle container technology and applying its principle - Same development environment - Same deployment environment
