Collaborate with ColmenaTech, ImplementÂ´s AWS virtual machines, with Ubuntu
   and the Odoo CRM for electronic invoicing in Costa Rica.
This collaboration gave me many knowledge of installing Linux systems,
  with the deployment and exploitation of the CRM, obtaining skills in reading system registers,
  solving connection errors and creating virtual connections (VLAN).
I managed to deploy the container system, with the collaboration of [joker charlie / odoo-dkr-cr: 12.0],
  Understand the virtualization system with containers, create  scripts to deploy all the containers,
  reaching the final publication of the connected Odoo CRM with the SQL engine "PostgreSQL"
Thus learning to handle container technology and applying its principle - Same development environment - Same deployment environment
