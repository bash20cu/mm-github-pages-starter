As part of my coursework in data structures, I developed a video game using Java programming language. The game is a graphical adventure that incorporates elements of strategy and puzzles, and was created using the JavaFX graphics library.

During the game development process, I was able to apply my skills in object-oriented programming, software pattern design, and resource management. I also gained experience in using tools such as Eclipse and NetBeans, and in creating user interfaces by building windows and dialogs using JavaFX.

If you're interested in learning more about my Java game project, please feel free to contact me for further details.
