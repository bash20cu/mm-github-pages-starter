## Collaboration with ColmenaTech on Odoo
![image-left]({{"/assets/images/ColmenaTech.jpg"|absolute_url}}){: .align-left}
I collaborated with ColmenaTech in the implementation of AWS virtual machines with Ubuntu and the Odoo CRM for electronic invoicing in Costa Rica. This collaboration gave me a lot of knowledge of installing Linux systems and deploying and exploiting the CRM, as well as skills in reading system registers, solving connection errors, and creating virtual connections (VLAN). I also managed to deploy the container system with the collaboration of joker charlie/odoo-dkr-cr: 12.0 and learned to handle container technology and apply its principle - Same development environment - Same deployment environment.
