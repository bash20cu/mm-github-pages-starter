## [Oracle Next Education with Alura LATAM](https://bash20cu.github.io/ONE-Alura/)
I have completed the ALURA LATAM course, which covered a wide range of frontend techniques and tools. Through this course, I gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other popular technologies used in frontend development. I learned how to create responsive web pages, build interactive user interfaces, and optimize website performance.

This course has enabled me to take on various frontend projects and deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of clients. I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills to new projects and continue learning and growing as a frontend developer.
