## [Inventario PyDev win32](https://github.com/bash20cu/inventario_py_dev_0.5){:target="_blank"}

I created the Inventario PyDev app to handle the invoice system of a little store or business using Python 2.7 language and Django framework. The app is free to use and has already been deployed using Py-To-Exe. You can find more information about Inventario PyDev on 

These projects have allowed me to learn and improve my skills in different areas, from real-time analysis and customer service to web development and container technology.
