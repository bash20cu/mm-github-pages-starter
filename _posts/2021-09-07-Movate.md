## Junior Software Developer at Movate (CSSCORP)

I have been working at CSSCORP since November 2020, where I have had the opportunity to work as a Real Time Analyst and Junior Software Developer. In my role as Real Time Analyst, I have been responsible for the development of reports in excel with macros, as well as automation with Microsoft Automate of the PTO report and approvals. I have also been in charge of the real-time analysis of the workload, as well as the behavior of the teams and call loads, managing rest times for several teams with over 150 agents. My role as Junior Software Developer has involved learning the codebase connectivity tool project using jQuery, creating web applications for Commscope/ARRIS using HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS, and auditing, designing, and implementing Commscope/ARRIS G34 web simulator using HTML5, CSS3, VanillaJS, and PHP. I have also collaborated on the debugging and analysis of the source code and attended design meetings with the client every week, participating in all the updates. 


###  Connectivity tool 
![image-left]({{"/assets/images/ConnectivityTool.jpg"|absolute_url}}){: .align-left}
This project is a connectivity tool that has evolved over time to include new features and improvements. It has been developed using web development tools such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and Less. The project is available on GitHub and several versions of the JSON language have been used to develop the tool. A flowchart has been created to show how to use the tool and it has evolved over time to improve its functionality. The tool is used to troubleshoot technical issues on devices and has been enhanced to be compatible with modern browsers. The user can specify the location of the JSON files used in the tool. The "debug" value can also be changed to enable or disable the display of step names when hovering over them. Tool steps can be created in a JSON file using a series of options including "Question", "Popmsg", "Poplink", "Text", "QuestionsTemplate", "NoNotes", "Noteheight", "Table", "Skips", and "Buttons".

The Simulators project is a web page that simulates an application used to configure the equipment sold by Arris. This page helps the service agent improve their responsiveness by visualizing what the customer needs to configure.
The website uses vanillaJS technology.
