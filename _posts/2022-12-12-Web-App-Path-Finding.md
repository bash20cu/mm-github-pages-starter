## Web Application for Graph Visualization and Shortest Path Finding using Dijkstra's Algorithm
As part of my Discrete Mathematics course, I created a web project that implemented Dijkstra's algorithm. Using jQuery, I created an interactive map where the user can click to add nodes, assign weights, and create edges between them, creating a graph. The algorithm then calculates the shortest path between two selected nodes and highlights it on the map.

This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of discrete mathematics, data structures, and algorithms in a practical way. It also helped me develop my skills in web development, particularly with jQuery and JSON. Additionally, I made the project available online for other students to use, which helped me develop my skills in project management and collaboration.
